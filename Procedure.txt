Speech-to-Text Transcription App Documentation
=============================================

This application converts spoken audio (from files or microphone) into text with timestamps using OpenAI's Whisper model.

Core Components
---------------
1. Audio Input Handling
   - Accepts MP3/WAV files (via upload)
   - Supports real-time microphone input (local execution only)

2. Audio Processing
   - Uses librosa to load and resample audio to 16kHz (Whisper's required format)
   - Applies noise reduction (noisereduce) for clearer transcription

3. Speech Recognition
   - Powered by Whisper (OpenAI's ASR model)
   - Generates text + word-level timestamps

4. Web Interface
   - Built with Streamlit for easy file upload and transcription

Workflow
--------

File-Based Transcription:
1. User Uploads Audio
   - Drag & drop an MP3/WAV file into the Streamlit app

2. Audio Preprocessing
   - librosa.load() reads the file and resamples it to 16kHz
   - Optional: noisereduce cleans background noise

3. Speech-to-Text Conversion
   - Whisper processes the audio and returns:
     * Transcribed text
     * Timestamps for each segment (start/end times)

4. Output Display
   - The app shows:
     * Playable audio (for verification)
     * Formatted transcription with timestamps

Real-Time Microphone Transcription:
(Runs locally, not on Streamlit Cloud due to mic access restrictions)

1. Microphone Activation
   - The script captures live audio using sounddevice

2. Audio Chunk Processing
   - Each 1-3 sec chunk is sent to Whisper

3. Continuous Output
   - Transcripts appear in real-time in the console

Technical Details
----------------
Key Functions:
- librosa.load(): Reads audio files & resamples to 16kHz
- noisereduce.reduce_noise(): Removes background noise
- whisper.transcribe(): Converts speech → text + timestamps
- sounddevice.InputStream(): Captures live microphone input

Why Librosa?
- Handles MP3/WAV/OGG seamlessly
- Automatic resampling (critical for Whisper)
- More reliable than pydub for edge-case files

Why Noise Reduction?
- Improves accuracy in noisy recordings
- Uses spectral gating (noisereduce) to filter out static

Example Output:
[0.00s - 4.00s]  Hi, this voice is used for testing purpose.
